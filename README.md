# ICS110

Analytical Question
=========================
-Is the maximum proton flux at Earth correlated to the intensity of solar flares on the Sun?

-Are properties of interplanetary space, such as solar wind speed or temperature, indicators of maximum proton flux at Earth?

-What are the statistical deviations from the background during intense solar events?

Data
=========================
The data consists of mainly flux data from instruments on the ground, Earth orbit, and at the L1 Lagrange point. The data includes a sample from (2012 March), not normalized, and complete in intervals of about 30 seconds to a minute. Data values that were not accepted are denoted at extreme negative values around -9999. The specifics of each data set is commented in each header.
